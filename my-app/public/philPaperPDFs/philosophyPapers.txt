"title" : "The Case for Ethical and Normative Narrativity",
"body" : "In the paper 'Against Narrativity', Strawson presents a framework which categorizes different styles of self constitution into 2 main categories: the Diachronic, and the Episodic. The Diachronic supports a path towards a conception of Personal Identity through Narrativity. This Narrativity is represented in the claims of the Normative and Ethical theses. Strawson argues against both of these theses and supports an Episodic view of Personal Identity. In this essay, I will responding to Strawson and defend an alternative interpretaion of the Narrativity theses.",

"title" : "Sterelnys' Defense Against Clark and Chalmers",
"body" : "I disagree with Clark and Chalmers idea of the Extended mind by proposing Sterelny's Scaffolded mind hypothesis. The Extended mind presents the idea that extracranial objects can be considered part of the mind if they meet certain requirements. This allows for claims such as external devices, such as phones or calendars, to be considered part of ones mind. I argue against this theses by supporting the Scaffolded mind which treats external objects as a support for our mind without incorporating it within the mind itself.",

"title" : "On the Nature of Weakness of Will",
"body" : "Here, I explore ideas surrounding the nature of will and what it means to have or act in accordance of free will. I argue against the notion that weakness of will is the reason as to why individuals do not act according to reason. Rather, an individuals desires collectively constitute a rational process different from the one understood by that individual. I tackle this subject using Frankfurts understanding of first and second order desires.",

"title" : "Science as a Paradigm",
"body" : "I argue that while science has gained power in modern society, there should be room for other forms of truth to exist, including religious truths, to prevent the monopolization of truth by science. I argue that what we know as truth are relative to the paradigms that they exist within. Furthermore, if paradigms conflict, we must be indifferent as we have no reason to assume one above the other. We must be careful to understand that, when these truths are taught, it is as a mechanism to obtain a scientific paradigm's truth rather than truth as something stance independent.",
